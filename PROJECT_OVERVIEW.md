   - Added liquidity management functionality
   - Implemented tax exclusion system
   - Implemented transaction limits exclusion system

2. **Testing**:
   - Created unit tests for basic token functionality
   - Tested owner functions and permissions
   - Verified tax and transaction limits behavior

3. **Deployment Tools**:
   - Created deployment script with proper error handling
   - Created contract verification script
   - Added deployment documentation

## Token Features

- **Token Standard**: ERC-20
- **Name**: The Wally Group Token
- **Symbol**: TWG
- **Decimals**: 18

## Deployment Plan

### Token Distribution

- 4% (400,000,000 TWG) for Team Reserves (with 3-month vesting)

- 15% (1,500,000,000 TWG) for Liquidity
- 43% (4,300,000,000 TWG) for Project/Marketing

### Deployment Steps

1. Deploy the contract with the tax collector address
2. Verify the contract on Etherscan
3. Create vesting schedules for team wallets
4. Distribute tokens to project and migrator wallets
5. Add liquidity to Uniswap
6. Enable trading when ready to launch

## Security Considerations

- Owner controls sensitive functions like enabling trading and excluding addresses from limits
- Proper security checks are in place to prevent misuse of functions
- Owner can recover mistakenly sent tokens (except TWG tokens)
- Consider a full smart contract audit before mainnet deployment

## Next Steps

- [ ] Deploy to Sepolia testnet for final testing
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing with real wallets
- [ ] Consider a professional security audit
- [ ] Finalize marketing materials
- [ ] Prepare social media announcements for launch
- [ ] Schedule mainnet deployment
- [ ] Prepare Uniswap listing
